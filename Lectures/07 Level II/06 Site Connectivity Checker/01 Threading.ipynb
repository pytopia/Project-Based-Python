    "The implementation of threading in the Site Connectivity Checker project brings to light several key advantages, particularly for I/O-bound tasks such as checking the availability of websites. These benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Concurrent Execution**: Threading allows multiple website checks to occur simultaneously, significantly reducing the total execution time compared to a sequential approach.\n",
    "- **Improved Responsiveness**: For applications that require maintaining responsiveness while performing background tasks (such as a GUI application), threading can perform long-running checks without freezing the user interface.\n",
    "- **Efficient Use of Waiting Time**: In I/O-bound operations where the task spends a significant amount of time waiting for external responses, threading helps utilize this waiting time to initiate other operations, thereby optimizing the application's overall efficiency.\n"

    "- **Race Conditions**: When two or more threads access shared data and try to change it at the same time, it can lead to inconsistent or unexpected outcomes.\n",
    "- **Thread Safety**: Not all code is thread-safe, meaning it can produce errors or unexpected results when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. Special care must be taken when accessing shared resources or mutable data structures.\n",
    "- **Deadlocks**: This occurs when two or more threads are waiting on each other to release resources, causing all of them to remain blocked indefinitely.\n",

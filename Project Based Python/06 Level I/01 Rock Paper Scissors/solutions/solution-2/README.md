# Rock Paper Scissors Game - Python Project

This project is a Python-based implementation of the popular game "Rock, Paper, Scissors", executed from a functional programming perspective. You have the opportunity to face off against a computer opponent, which makes its moves based on random choice. The game continues until you decide to quit. 

## Project Structure
```

├── src/
│   ├── main.py - File with the game's functions and play logic

```

## Requirements
1. Python 3.7+

## Running the Project
To run the project:

```python
python src/main.py
```

In this solution, the Rock Paper Scissors game logic is implemented using a procedural or functional programming approach. The source code includes functions to get the user's and the computer's choices, determine the winner, and to play the game repeatedly until the user decides to quit.

When you run the script, you'll be prompted to make a choice, after which the computer's choice is randomly generated and the winner is declared. The game will continue to run until you decide to quit.

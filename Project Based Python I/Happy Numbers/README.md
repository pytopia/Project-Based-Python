# Happy Numbers
> DIFFICULTY: **EASY**

A **happy number** is defined by the following process. 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the **sum of the squares of its digits**, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

## TODO

1. Write a function to check if the number is a happy number.
2. Write a function to extract digits of a number.
3. Write a function to get the user input and printing happy numbers greater than it.
